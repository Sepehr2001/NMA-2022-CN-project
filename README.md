## Project Abstract:
In order to share, compare and reproduce the outcome of an experiment, we need reproducible methods to approach the same results. Here we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. Decision making is the process of making choices by identifying a decision, gathering information, and assessing alternative resolutions.
We used data resulting from IBL Dataset, standardized mice training protocol. The dataset contains information about 140 trained mice across seven laboratories in three countries. The standard protocol includes information about different constant and variable parameters across labs. The constant parameters were mouse strain and provider, age range, weight range, water access, food protein and fat. The variable parameters were light-dark cycle, temperature, humidity, caging, mice gender and environmental sound. Besides, these varaibles were measured regularly and documented in the dataset.
Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories at the early stages of learning(the first 10-15 days), but once training was completed there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories.
The learning rate variety across different labs attracted our attention to investigate the reason behind that diversity.Thatâ€™s how we made our goal of study.
Our research question was how labrotories ambient parameters can affect mice learning process and their decision making.The answer of this question requires a quantified how-model.
Thus, We extracted ambient variables, mice sex, mouse wise and lab wise performances and then impplemented our models.
